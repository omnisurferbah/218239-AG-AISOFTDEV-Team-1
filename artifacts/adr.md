# Adopt Postgres with pgvector for Vector Similarity Search

**Status:** Accepted

## Context

We need to implement a feature that relies on storing and querying high-dimensional vector embeddings, such as for a semantic search or a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system. This requires a solution that can efficiently find the "nearest neighbors" to a given query vector.

The core architectural decision is whether to use a specialized vector search library like FAISS (which would require a dedicated microservice and a separate metadata store) or to extend our existing relational database, Postgres, with a vector-capable extension like `pgvector`.

Our primary goals are to deliver this functionality in a way that is reliable, maintainable, and minimizes new operational complexity. The solution must support transactional updates and allow for efficient filtering of vectors based on their associated metadata (e.g., filtering by user ID, document type, or creation date).

## Decision

We will adopt **Postgres with the `pgvector` extension** as our primary system for storing, managing, and querying vector embeddings.

This approach provides a single, unified datastore for both vectors and their associated metadata. All data interactions will occur through standard SQL queries, simplifying the application architecture and leveraging our team's existing expertise with Postgres.

## Consequences

### Positive

*   **Reduced Operational Complexity:** We will manage a single system (Postgres) instead of two (a FAISS service and a separate metadata database). This simplifies deployment, monitoring, backups, and security.
*   **Simplified Development & Data Integrity:** With a unified data store, there is no need to manage data consistency between a vector index and a metadata store. Developers can use a single database connection and a single query language (SQL) for all operations. `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE` operations on vectors and metadata are atomic and transactional (ACID-compliant).
*   **Powerful & Efficient Filtering:** We can leverage the full power of SQL `WHERE` clauses to filter results by metadata *before* the vector search is performed. This is significantly more efficient than the common pattern of retrieving many vector results and filtering them afterward in application code (post-filtering).
*   **Real-time Data Updates:** `pgvector` supports standard, real-time `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE` operations. The index is updated automatically and transactionally, which is difficult to achieve with static, in-memory indexes like FAISS that often require periodic rebuilding.
*   **Leverages Existing Expertise:** Our team is already proficient in managing and scaling Postgres. This choice avoids the learning curve and operational overhead associated with building, deploying, and maintaining a new, specialized microservice.

### Negative

*   **Potentially Slower Raw Search Performance:** For pure, unfiltered vector search operations, a specialized, in-memory library like FAISS may offer lower latency. `pgvector` performance is excellent but includes the overhead of the Postgres database engine and network communication.
*   **Fewer Advanced Indexing Options:** FAISS offers a wider variety of highly specific index types for fine-tuning the trade-offs between speed, memory, and accuracy. `pgvector` provides industry-standard, high-performance indexes like HNSW and IVFFlat, which are sufficient for our needs, but the selection is less extensive.

### Neutral/Risks

*   **Scalability is Tied to Postgres:** Our ability to scale the vector search workload is coupled with our standard Postgres scaling strategy (e.g., vertical scaling, read replicas). This is a well-understood pattern but differs from scaling a stateless search service horizontally.
*   **Performance is Resource-Dependent:** The performance of vector searches, particularly with HNSW indexes, is sensitive to the amount of RAM available to the Postgres server. We must monitor resource utilization carefully and provision the database instance appropriately to ensure low-latency responses as the dataset grows.
