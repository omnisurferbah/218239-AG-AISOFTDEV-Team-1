### 1. Introduction

#### 1.1. Overview
This document outlines the product requirements for **CUDA-Assist**, a web-based, conversational AI assistant designed to help developers learn and use the CUDA C++ parallel computing platform. The core of this product is a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that leverages the official **NVIDIA CUDA C++ Programming Guide** as its single source of truth.

#### 1.2. Problem Statement
The CUDA C++ Programming Guide is the definitive resource for parallel programming on NVIDIA GPUs. However, its comprehensive nature makes it dense and difficult for new developers to navigate. Finding specific answers to practical programming questions often requires sifting through hundreds of pages, which slows down the learning process and developer productivity. Developers need a way to get quick, context-aware, and actionable answers without leaving their development workflow.

#### 1.3. Project Objectives
*   **Reduce Learning Curve:** Drastically shorten the time it takes for new developers to find answers to fundamental and advanced CUDA concepts.
*   **Improve Developer Productivity:** Provide instant, accurate answers and code examples to common CUDA programming problems, allowing developers to solve issues faster.
*   **Increase Engagement with CUDA Documentation:** Create an interactive and user-friendly entry point to the official documentation, encouraging deeper exploration through verified source links.

#### 1.4. Target Audience
*   **Primary:** Novice to intermediate C++ developers who are new to CUDA and parallel programming. They are typically students, researchers, or software engineers looking to accelerate their applications.
*   **Secondary:** Experienced CUDA developers looking for a quick reference for specific API syntax, function parameters, or best practices without needing to search the full PDF document.

#### 1.5. Scope
*   **In-Scope:**
    *   Answering natural language questions based *exclusively* on the content of the latest stable version of the CUDA C++ Programming Guide.
    *   Providing relevant code snippets found within the guide.
    *   Citing the specific sections or pages of the guide from which the information was retrieved.
    *   A simple, clean web interface for interaction.
*   **Out-of-Scope (for Version 1.0):**
    *   Answering general C++ or non-CUDA programming questions.
    *   Debugging user-provided code that is not a direct example from the guide.
    *   Providing performance tuning advice beyond what is explicitly stated in the guide.
    *   Knowledge from external sources (e.g., Stack Overflow, blogs, other NVIDIA library documentation like cuBLAS or cuDNN).
    *   User accounts or persistent conversation history across sessions.

### 2. User Stories

| ID    | As a...                     | I want to...                                                               | So that I can...                                                              |
| :---- | :-------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **US-01** | new CUDA developer          | ask a basic conceptual question like, "What is a CUDA kernel?"             | understand the fundamental execution model of CUDA without reading a full chapter.  |
| **US-02** | developer writing code      | ask for the syntax of a specific function, like "How do I use `cudaMalloc`?" | get the correct parameters and usage details quickly and accurately.          |
| **US-03** | developer looking for a pattern | ask for a code example for a common task, like "Show me how to copy memory from host to device." | see a practical implementation that I can adapt for my own code.              |
| **US-04** | developer making design choices | ask a comparative question, such as "What is the difference between shared and global memory?" | make an informed decision about memory management for my kernel.          |
| **US-05** | developer troubleshooting   | ask about best practices or common issues, like "What are the rules for thread synchronization?" | avoid common pitfalls and write more robust, correct code.                     |
| **US-06** | user of the chatbot         | see a direct link or reference to the source section in the official documentation | verify the information's accuracy and read more deeply if I need to.           |
| **US-07** | user of the chatbot         | be clearly informed when my question cannot be answered from the documentation | trust that the system is not inventing answers (hallucinating).              |
| **US-08** | user of the chatbot         | provide feedback on the quality of an answer (e.g., thumbs up/down)        | help improve the chatbot's performance and accuracy over time.                |

### 3. Functional Requirements

#### FR-1: Natural Language Query Handling
*   **FR-1.1: Input Interface:** The user interface must feature a text input field where users can type their questions in plain English.
*   **FR-1.2: Query Understanding:** The system must parse the user's natural language query to identify the core intent and key entities (e.g., function names like `cudaMemcpy`, concepts like `streams` or `warps`).
*   **FR-1.3: Follow-up Questions:** While full conversational memory is out of scope for v1.0, the system should handle simple, contextual follow-ups within the same immediate interaction (e.g., User: "What is a CUDA stream?" -> Bot: [answers] -> User: "How do I create one?").

#### FR-2: Retrieval of Relevant Information
*   **FR-2.1: Knowledge Source:** The system's knowledge base shall be composed solely of the content from the official CUDA C++ Programming Guide (latest stable version). The ingestion process must handle text, tables, and code blocks from the source document (e.g., PDF or HTML).
*   **FR-2.2: Semantic Retrieval:** Upon receiving a query, the system must use vector-based semantic search to identify and retrieve the most relevant text chunks, code examples, and table data from the knowledge base. The retrieval mechanism must be optimized for technical accuracy.
*   **FR-2.3: Multi-Chunk Retrieval:** The system must be capable of retrieving and synthesizing information from multiple different sections of the document to answer complex questions that span several topics.

#### FR-3: Generation of Concise, User-Friendly Responses
*   **FR-3.1: Synthesized Answers:** The Large Language Model (LLM) must generate a coherent, human-readable answer based on the retrieved context. The answer should directly address the user's question.
*   **FR-3.2: Response Formatting:**
    *   **Code Blocks:** All code snippets must be displayed in a monospaced font within a formatted code block, with appropriate C++/CUDA syntax highlighting.
    *   **Clarity:** Answers should be concise and avoid jargon where possible, unless explaining the jargon itself. Key terms should be clearly defined.
*   **FR-3.3: Source Citations:** Every answer must be accompanied by one or more citations that link directly to the relevant page or section of the official CUDA C++ Programming Guide. This is critical for user trust and verification.
*   **FR-3.4: Handling "I Don't Know":** If the retrieval process fails to find relevant information or has low confidence, the chatbot must respond with a clear, honest message stating that it cannot answer the question based on the provided documentation (e.g., "I could not find an answer to your question in the CUDA C++ Programming Guide."). It must not invent an answer.

### 4. Success Metrics

The success of the CUDA-Assist chatbot will be measured by its ability to provide accurate, useful information that demonstrably improves the developer experience.

#### 4.1. User Satisfaction and Engagement
*   **Answer-Level Feedback:** A simple "thumbs up / thumbs down" rating mechanism on each response.
    *   *Target:* >85% "thumbs up" rating on all rated responses.
*   **User Satisfaction Score (CSAT):** A periodic, optional pop-up asking users to rate their overall experience on a 1-5 scale.
    *   *Target:* Average score of >4.2/5.0.
*   **Daily Active Users (DAU) & Monthly Active Users (MAU):** Measures adoption and sustained usage over time.
    *   *Target:* Achieve 1,000 MAU within 3 months of public launch.
*   **Queries per Session:** The average number of questions a user asks in a single session.
    *   *Target:* An average of >3 queries per session, indicating users find it useful for multiple problems.

#### 4.2. Accuracy and Performance
*   **Retrieval Precision:** (Internal Metric) The percentage of retrieved document chunks that are relevant to the user's query. Measured using a golden test set.
    *   *Target:* >90% precision on the evaluation set.
*   **Groundedness/Faithfulness:** (Internal Metric) The percentage of generated answers that are factually supported by the retrieved context. Measured via human or LLM-based evaluation.
    *   *Target:* >95% of answers are fully grounded in the source material.
*   **Citation Click-Through Rate (CTR):** The percentage of responses where a user clicks on a source citation link.
    *   *Target:* >15% CTR, indicating users value the source verification feature.
*   **Rate of "I Don't Know" (IDK) Responses:** The percentage of queries that result in an "I don't know" answer.
    *   *Goal:* Monitor this metric. A very high rate may indicate poor retrieval. A rate of zero may indicate the bot is hallucinating. A healthy rate (e.g., 5-10%) suggests it is correctly identifying out-of-scope questions.

#### 4.3. Learning and Productivity Outcomes
*   **Qualitative Feedback:** A dedicated, optional text field for users to submit comments on how the chatbot helped them.
    *   *Goal:* Collect and analyze testimonials related to time saved and problems solved.
*   **Task Completion Rate (Survey-based):** An occasional survey asking, "Were you able to solve your problem using the chatbot's answer?"
    *   *Target:* >80% "Yes" responses.
